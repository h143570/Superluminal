Superluminal
============

Superluminal is a ship editor for the game [FTL: Faster Than Light](http://www.ftlgame.com/), allowing the user to design new ships, or modify existing ones.

To download the editor or post comments, visit the [editor's thread](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=11251) on the official forums.

The source code is admittedly a horrible aberration. New, AE-compatible version of the editor can be found here - [superluminal2](https://github.com/kartoFlane/superluminal2)
